		<p style="color:white;">At the heart of the A35 4Matic is a revised version of Mercedes-Benzâ€™s M260 engine, as used by the A250. It is described by AMG as a new development, although the new four-cylinder unit shares its 83.0mm bore and 92.0mm stroke measurements and design of its die-cast aluminium crankcase with the M133 engine of the A45 4Matic.
Key engineering attributes of the AMG-tweaked powerplant include uniquely tuned twin-scroll turbochargers with reduced back pressure, reprogrammed Camtronic variable valve control, special liners that contribute to conically shaped cylinders and a bespoke exhaust system with an automatically controlled flap that modulates the exhaust note depending on the driving mode.
With 302bhp at 5800rpm and 295lb ft of torque between 3000rpm and 4000rpm, the transversely mounted engine delivers 81bhp and 77lb ft, more than the less heavily tuned version of the M260 unit used by the A250 but 74bhp and 55lb ft less than the more highly strung M133 engine used by the A45 4Matic.</p>
